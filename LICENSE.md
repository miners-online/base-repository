## 1. Definitions

**1.1 Publicly Accessible**
“Publicly accessible” means any environment in which the Software or any derivative is available to **any human other than the operator**.
This includes whitelists, invitations, authentication systems, private friend groups, or restricted-access servers.
If more than one human can connect or participate, the use is considered public.

**1.2 Single-Human Multi-User Testing**
“Single-human multi-user testing” refers to any scenario in which multiple connected user sessions exist, provided **all sessions are controlled entirely by one human operator**.
Examples include multiple local clients, automated bots, scripted test players, simulators, or load tests.

## 2. Permitted Uses

**2.1 Private Single-Human Use**
You are permitted to use, study, modify, and create derivative works of the Software solely for private use, provided no other human can connect, participate, or observe through the Software.

**2.2 Single-Human Multi-User Testing**
Multi-user operation is permitted only when every connected user session is under the exclusive control of a single human operator, as defined in Section 1.2.

**2.3 Local Development and Research**
The Software may be used for development, experimentation, academic work, and internal research, provided such use stays within the restrictions above.

## 3. Prohibited Uses

**3.1 Public Deployment**
The Software, including any modifications or derivatives, may not be used to operate or support any publicly accessible game server, game network, or interactive service, regardless of revenue or monetization.

**3.2 Multi-Human Access**
Any multi-user environment involving more than one human participant is prohibited.

**3.3 Competitive Services**
The Software or any derivative may not be used in any context intended to attract, serve, or retain a player base as an alternative to Miners Online, nor used to operate a game service that competes with Miners Online.

**3.4 Distribution of Multi-Human-Ready Builds**
You may not distribute preconfigured builds or derivatives designed or intended to enable multi-human access.

## 4. Distribution and Contribution Requirements

**4.1 Contribution Obligation**
Modifications, enhancements, fixes, or derivative works must be offered back to the Miners Online project via patches or pull requests, unless the work remains entirely private under Section 2 and is never distributed.

**4.2 Source and Derivative Distribution**
Distribution of the Software or derivative works is permitted only if:
- this license accompanies the distribution, and
- the distributed work is not intended for, or capable of, public or multi-human operation.

## 5. Trademarks

This license does not grant rights to use the “Miners Online” name, branding, or associated trademarks in any public-facing or promotional manner without written permission.

## 6. Warranty Disclaimer

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

If you want to refine it further—for example by adding explicit examples, tightening the competitive clause, or aligning it with a copyleft-style structure—it can be shaped into whichever style best suits the project’s goals.
